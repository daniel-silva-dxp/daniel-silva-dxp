### Hi there 👋

My name is Daniel Silva from Brasil (🇧🇷). I have been working as a front-end developer since 2017 and I am currently a developer at [Grapeway Cloud Evolution](https://www.grapeway.com.br). Dealing with people in times of quick, light and intelligent information made me understand that success and the answers are actually in the questions. And that's how I found the way. If you are also wondering which way, I already know it well!
Developing has become a favorite hobby.

In my spare time, I like to play (and watch) football (⚽️), watch movies (🎞️), read books (📚), listen to music (🎵) and eventually like to philosophize about life with a beer (🍺).

Would you like to meet me?
